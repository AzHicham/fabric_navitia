## Git hooks
The project provides a few git hooks that you should use to prevent any issues.
These hooks are managed by [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
that you need to [install](https://pre-commit.com/#install).
Then you can install the hooks with:
```
pre-commit install
```

You can run all hooks manualy by running:
```
pre-commit install
```
